#What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?
start to understand coding and using terminal is hard.

#What was easy(-ish) even though we havenâ€™t done it in class?
nothing is easy to me because this is my first coding experience.

#If this was the first time you were using git, how do you feel about it?
its a pretty good website to record my stuff.

#If this was the first time using GitHub, how do you feel about it?
its good!

#Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helpedyou?
Yes, I always need help during doing the assignment.

#How much time did it take to complete this HW?
about 4 hours

#What was the most time consuming part?
assignment and importing the data set

#Was there anything that you did not understand? or fully grasped?
I thinl I am bad at debugging, like I dont understand the message when the error poped out

#Was there anything frustrating in particular?
no

#Was there anything exciting? Something that you feel proud of?
yes, I can finally make a graph from a data set!!
