#title: Ranking NBA Teams
#description: From the analytical point of view, we will focus on ranking tasks.This will give us an excuseto introduce Principal Components Analysis (PCA), from a narrow yet useful perspective.One of the deliverables is to calculate a composite index to rank NBA teams.
#input(s): what are the inputs required by the script?
#output(s): what are the outputs created when running the script?
